About
-----

*asm6809* is a portable macro cross assembler targeting the Motorola 6809 and
Hitachi 6309.

Text is read in and parsed, then as many passes are made over the parsed source
as necessary (up to a limit), until symbols are resolved and addresses are
stable.  The fastest or smallest representation should always be chosen where
there is ambiguity.

Output formats are: Raw binary, DragonDOS binary, CoCo RS-DOS (or "DECB")
binary, Motorola SREC, Intel HEX.

If more than one SOURCE-FILE is specified, they are assembled as though
they were all in one file.


### Differences to other assemblers

Motorola syntax allows a comment to follow any operands, separated from them
only by whitespace.  To an extent, this assembler accepts that, but be aware
that as spaces are allowed within expressions, if the comment looks like it is
continuing an expression it will generate bad code (or raise an error if the
result is syntactically incorrect).  Example:

~~~
0000  8605                    lda     #5
0002  C60A                    ldb     #5 * 2    twice the first number
~~~

A strict Motorola assembler would generate bytes C6 05 for the second line, as
the "* 2" would be ignored.  For consistency, it is best to introduce end of
line comments with a ";" character.  An asterisk ("\*") can introduce whole
line comments.

An unquoted semicolon always introduces a comment.  The alternate form of the
6309 instructions **AIM**, **OIM**, etc. listed in some documentation that uses
a semicolon as a separator is not accepted.

A symbol may be forward referenced; any time a reference is unresolvable,
another pass is triggered, up to some defined maximum.

In 6809 indexed addressing, the offset size will default to the fastest
possible form, e.g., if the offset is an expression that happens to evaluate to
zero, the "no offset" form will be used.  Prepend "<<" to coerce a 5 bit
offset, "<" to coerce 8 bits or ">" to coerce 16 bits.

This project follows on from its Perl script predecessor, however some of its
features are not yet supported.  An important difference in accepted syntax is
the pasting of macro parameters to form symbol names.  Any parameter passed for
this purpose must be quoted.  The method of coercing the width of an offset has
changed to be more sensible, too.

*asm6809* has no support for OS-9 modules or multiple object linking.


Program syntax
--------------

Program files are considered line by line.  Each line contains up to three
fields, separated by whitespace: label, instruction and arguments.  An unquoted
semicolon (";") indicates that the rest of the line is to be considered a
comment.  Whole line comments may be introduced with an asterisk ("\*").
Motorola-style end of line comments without a ";" are accepted, but see the
notes about assembler differences.

Any label must appear at the very beginning of the line.  If a label is
omitted, whitespace must appear before the operator field.  Certain pseudo-ops
affect a label's meaning, but their usual purpose is to define a symbol
referring to the current position in the code (Program Counter, or PC).  The
next most common use is with the **EQU** pseudo-op, which assigns a particular
value to a symbol.

The instruction field contains either instruction op-codes (mnemonics),
pseudo-ops (assembler directives) or macro names for expansion.

Arguments are a comma-separated list, either instruction operands or arguments
to a pseudo-op or macro.  Permitted arguments are specific to the instruction
or pseudo-op, but in general they may be:

 * An expression.
 * A register name, with optional pre-decrement or post-increment.
 * A string delimited either by double quotes or "/".
 * A nested list surrounded by "[" and "]".  This is generally only used to
   indicate indirect indexed addressing.

In addition, any argument may be preceded by:

 * "#", indicate immediate value.
 * "<<", force 5-bit index offset.
 * "<", force direct addressing, 8-bit value or 8-bit index offset.
 * ">", force extended addressing, 16-bit value or 16-bit index offset.


### Expressions

Expressions are formed of:

 * A decimal number.
 * An octal number preceded by "@".
 * A binary number preceded by "%" or "0b".
 * A hexadecimal number preceded by "$" or "0x".
 * A floating point number (decimal digits surrounding exactly one ".").
 * A single quote followed by any ASCII character (yielding the ASCII value of
   that character).
 * A symbol name, local forward reference or local back reference.
 * A combination of any of the above with arithmetic, bitwise or logical
   operators.
 * Any of the above prefixed with a unary minus ("-") or plus ("+").
 * Parenthesis to specify precedence.


### Operators

The following operators are available, listed in descending order of precedence
(where operators share a precedence, left-to-right evaluation is performed):

~~~
+       unary plus
-       unary minus
! ~     logical, bitwise NOT
----------------------------
*       multiplication
/       division
%       modulo
----------------------------
+       addition
-       subtraction
----------------------------
<<      bitwise shift left
>>      bitwise shift right
----------------------------
< <=    relational operators
> >=    relational operators
----------------------------
==      relational equal
!=      relational not equal
----------------------------
&       bitwise AND
----------------------------
^       bitwise XOR
----------------------------
|       bitwise OR
----------------------------
&&      logical AND
----------------------------
||      logical OR
----------------------------
?:      ternary operator
~~~

Division always results in a floating point result.  Other arithmetic operators
result in integers if both operands are integers, otherwise floating point.
Bitwise operators and modulo all cast their operands to integers and result in
an integer.  Relational and logical operators result in 0 if false, 1 if true.
Integer calculations are performed using the platform's *int64_t* type,
floating point uses *double*.


### Conditional assembly

The pseudo-ops **IF**, **ELSIF**, **ELSE** and **ENDIF** guide conditional
assembly.  **IF** and **ELSIF** take one argument, which is evaluated as an
integer.  If the result is non-zero, the following code will be assembled, else
it will be skipped.

While evaluating the expression to be tested, the usual "undefined reference"
errors are suppressed, and instead any undefined expression is interpreted as a
zero (false).

Conditional assembly pseudo-ops are permitted within macro definitions and will
be evaluated at the time of expansion, therefore positional variables can be
used to affect macro expansion.


### Sections

Code can be placed into named sections with the **SECTION** pseudo-op.  This
can make breaking source into multiple input files more comfortable.  Without
**ORG** or **PUT** directives, sections will follow each other in memory in the
order they are first defined.

Within each section, there may exist multiple spans of discontiguous data.
Certain output formats are able to represent this, for the others (e.g.,
DragonDOS), the spans are combined first, with the gaps between them padded
with zero bytes.


### Local labels

Local labels are considered local to the current *section*.  A local label is
any decimal number used in the label field.  An exclamation mark ("!") is
considered the same as decimal zero.  Identical numerical labels may occur more
than once, other labels may not.

As an operand, a decimal number followed by "B" or "F" is considered to be a
back or forward reference to the previous or next occurrence of that numerical
local label in the section.  Operands of "<" and ">" are considered equivalent
to "0B" and "0F" respectively, and can therefore be used to refer to the  "!"
local label, as in some other assemblers.

Example:

~~~
0000  8E0400          scroll          ldx     #$0400
0003  EC8820          1               ldd     32,x
0006  ED81                            std     ,x++
0008  8C05E0                          cmpx    #$05e0
000B  25F6                            blo     1B
000D  CC6060                          ldd     #$6060
0010  ED81            1               std     ,x++
0012  8C0600                          cmpx    #$0600
0015  25F9                            blo     1B
0017  39                              rts
~~~

The "1" label occurs twice, but each reference to "1B" refers to the
closest one searching backwards.


### Macros

Start a macro definition by specifying a name for it in the label field, and
**MACRO** in the instruction field.  Finish the definition with **ENDM** in the
instruction field.

Use a macro by specifying its name in the instruction field.  Any arguments
given will be available during expansion as a positional variable.  The first
argument will be called *\\1*, the second *\\2*, etc.  For compatibility with
the TSC Flex assembler, the alternate forms *&{1}*, *&{2}*, etc. are also
accepted.  Within a string, the simpler *&1*, *&2*, etc. are still valid, but
as this can be confused with bitwise AND, it is not permitted outside a string.

Positional variables can be used within strings, or pasted to form symbol
names.  In either case, they must be quoted or they will be passed by value
(and an error will occur if they do not correspond to valid symbols by
themselves).

Here's a silly example demonstrating positional variables and symbol pasting.
Consider the following macro definition and utilising code:

~~~
go_left  equ     -1
go_right equ     +1

move            macro
                lda     x_position
                adda    #go_\1
                sta     x_position
                endm

do_move
                move    "right"
                rts

x_position      rmb     1
~~~

The main code generated is as follows:

~~~
0000                  do_move
0000                                  move    "right"
0000  B60009                          lda     x_position
0003  8B01                            adda    #go_\1
0005  B70009                          sta     x_position
0008  39                              rts
~~~


### Pseudo-ops

#### **ELSE**

Subsequent lines are assembled only if all preceding **IF** and **ELSIF**
pseudo-ops evaluated to false (zero).

#### **ELSIF**

Subsequent lines are assembled only if all preceding **IF** and **ELSIF**
pseudo-ops evaluated to false (zero) and *condition* evaluates to true
(non-zero).

#### **END** [*address*]

Signifies the end of input.  All further lines are disregarded.

Optionally specifies an EXEC address to be included in the output, where
supported by the output format.  An EXEC address specified on the command line
will override any value specified here.

#### **ENDIF**

Terminate an **IF** statement.

#### **ENDM**

Finish a macro definition started with **MACRO**.

#### **EQU** *value*

Short for "equate", this must be used with a label, and defines a symbol with
the specified *value*.  This may be any single valid argument (e.g., an
expression or a string) .

#### **EXPORT** *name*[, *name*]...

Each *name*, either the name of a macro or a symbol, is flagged to be exported.
Exported macros and symbols will be listed in the symbols output file, if
specified.

#### **FCB** *value*[, *value*]...
#### **FCC** *value*[, *value*]...

Form Constant Byte.  Each *value* is evaluated either to a number or a string.
Numbers are truncated to 8 bits and stored directly as bytes.  For strings, the
ASCII value of each character is stored in sequential bytes.

Historically, **FCB** handled bytes and **FCC** (Form Constant Character
string) handled strings.  *asm6809* treats them as synonymous, but is rather
more strict about what is allowed as a string delimiter.

#### **FCN** *value*[, *value*]...

Identical to **FCC**, but a terminating zero byte is stored after the data.
Included to increase compatibility with other assemblers.

#### **FDB** *value*[, *value*]...

Form Double Byte.  Each *value* is evaluated to a number, which is truncated to
16 bits and stored as two successive bytes (big-endian, of course).

#### **FILL** *value*, *count*

Insert *count* bytes of *value*.  This is effectively the same as the
two-argument form of **RZB** with its arguments swapped.

#### **IF** *condition*

Subsequent lines are assembled only if *condition* evaluates to true
(non-zero).

#### **INCLUDE** *filename*

Includes the contents of another file at this point in assembly.  The
*filename* argument must be a string, i.e., delimited by quotes or "/"
characters.

#### **INCLUDEBIN** *filename*

Includes the binary data from *filename* (which, as with **INCLUDE** must be a
delimited string) directly.

#### **MACRO**

Start defining a macro with a name specified by the line's label.  Subsequent
lines up to the enclosing **ENDM** pseudo-op will not be assembled until the
macro is expanded.  Macro definitions may be nested, that is a macro may define
another macro.

#### **ORG** *address*

Sets the Program Counter - the base address assumed for the next assembled
instruction.  Unless followed by a **PUT** pseudo-op, this will also be the
instruction's actual address in memory.  A label on the same line will define a
symbol with a value of the specified address.

#### **PUT** *address*

Modify the put address - the Program Counter is unaffected, so the assumed
address for subsequent instructions remains the same, but the actual data will
be located elsewhere.  Useful for assembling code that is going to be copied
into place before executing.

#### **RMB** *count*

Reserve Memory Bytes.  The Program Counter is advanced *count* bytes.  In some
output formats this region may be padded with zeroes, in others a new loadable
section may be created.

#### **RZB** *count*[, *value*]
#### **ZMB** *count*[, *value*]
#### **BSZ** *count*[, *value*]

Reserve Zeroed Bytes.  Inserts a sequence of *count* bytes of zero, or *value*
if specified.  The two-argument form is effectively the same as **FILL** with
its arguments swapped.

**ZMB** and **BSZ** are alternate forms recognised for compatibility with other
assemblers.

#### **SECTION** *name*
#### **CODE**
#### **DATA**
#### **BSS**
#### **RAM**
#### **AUTO**

Switch to the named section.  The Program Counter will continue from the last
value it had while assembling this section, or follow the previous section if
had not previously been seen.

Each of **CODE**, **DATA**, **BSS**, **RAM** and **AUTO** switches to a section
named after the pseudo-op.  They are recognised for compatibility with other
assemblers.

#### **SET** *value*

Similar to **EQU**, this must be used with a label, and defines a symbol with
the specified *value*.  Unlike **EQU**, you can use **SET** multiple times to
assign different values to the same symbol without error.  TODO: this should be
incompatible with other forms of assignment.

#### **SETDP** *page*

Set the assumed value of the Direct Page (**DP**) register to *page* for
subsequent instructions.  Any non-negative *page* is truncated to 8 bits, or
specify a negative number to disable automatic direct addressing.

See the section on Direct Page addressing for more information.


### Addressing modes

#### Direct Page

The 6809 extends the zero page concept by allowing fast accesses to whichever
page is selected by the Direct Page register (**DP**).  An assembler is not
able to keep track of what the code has set this register to, but the
information is useful when deciding which addressing mode to use for an
instruction.  The **SETDP** pseudo-op, or *\-\-setdp* option, informs the
assembler that the supplied value is to be assumed for **DP**.  Set this to a
negative number to undefine it, and disable automatic use of direct addressing
(this is the default).


Assembler operation
-------------------

### Assembly passes

The assembler uses multiple passes to resolve expressions.  If an expression
refers to a symbol that cannot currently be resolved, an extra pass is
triggered.  Similarly, if a symbol is assigned a value (e.g., by an **EQU**
pseudo-operation) that differs to its value on the previous pass, another is
triggered until it becomes stable.

As local labels can be repeated, their position is used to distinguish them.
For this reason, all file inclusions and macro expansion must occur during the
first pass so that the absolute line count at which each local label is
encountered remains the same between passes.
