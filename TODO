TODO
----

While functional, there's a lot still to be added or considered.  This list is
not necessarily complete, and in some regarts just acts as a scratch pad for me
to remember things that need doing.

### Medium priority

 * Conditional assembly pseudo-ops.
 * **PUT** not implemented - think about how.
 * **RZB** should support a fill value other than zero.
 * **ENDM** argument should match the opening MACRO if specified.
 * Check all symbols are valid.  After variable substitution (e.g., in macros),
   they might end up containing invalid characters.
 * Structs.

### Low priority

 * **INCLUDE** should push new positional variables.
 * **EQU** could permit any value, including lists.  A list could expand
   in-place somehow.
 * Should **DP** default to zero, not disabled?
 * Ability to specify maximum number of passes.
 * See if it's possible to support comments without a ";" in unambiguous
   sitiation.  Check out Bison/YACC error recovery.
 * As it stands, section names need to be quoted - can this requirement be
   lifted?  Similarly when pasting macro args - maybe pass a simplified ID?
 * 6800, 6801, 6803, 6309 ISA support.
 * Support the extended syntax pseudo-ops from the Perl version.
 * For CoCo3 and others, destination addresses could usefully be outside the
   64K range.
 * The limitation on inclusion and macro expansion occuring in the first pass
   could be lifted.  Should just be able to clear all local label tables
   whenever an expansion occurs in a later pass, and then trigger another one.
